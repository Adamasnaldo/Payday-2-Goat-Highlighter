# Payday-2-Goat-Highlighter

## Mod Description

Payday 2 BLT mod that highlights all the goats in day 1 of the Goat Simulator job

## AutoRelease

This GitHub has an Action to automatically create the release with the changelog, version and corresponding files (zip and meta.json)
Just go to the Actions tab and run it to create a new release (the name of the version and tag will be fetched from the version in the mod.txt file, which should be only numbers and dots)

## Credits

The action was heavily inspired (basically copied and adjusted a bit) on the Carry Stacker one,

The original code for the hash generation was made by fragtrane,
